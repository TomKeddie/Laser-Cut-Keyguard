Laser Cut Keyguards for AAC Devices and Keyboards

## Keyguards 
A keyguard is a thin plate that sits over top of a keyboard or an Alternate and Augmentative Communication (AAC) device. A keyguard may help a user use the keyboard or AAC device more easily and more effectively by helping them press buttons more accurately and helping support their hand or finger to reduce fatigue.
